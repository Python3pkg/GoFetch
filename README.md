**GoFetch** is an uber lightweight database framework for Python, now with added dog puns.

Sometimes you need a simple database and don't want to have to build up a ton of infrastructure or go down into the SQL to get it done.  GoFetch was built for this exact use case: providing the power of a database with a lightweight modeling framework.  It's for simple use cases, so it's a breeze to setup.
